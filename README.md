# Heart Disease Prediction

**End-to-end Heart Disease Prediction system using Machine Learning.**  
Predicts heart disease risk based on user medical inputs with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment via a web app (Flask/Streamlit).

## Features
- Data preprocessing & EDA  
- Model training & evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
- Saved model (`model.pkl`) for deployment  
- Real-time prediction via `app.py`  

## Tech Stack
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Flask/Streamlit  

## How to Run
1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/AparnaBhardwaj/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git`  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run app: `python app.py` → Open `http://localhost:5000`  

## Dataset
`heart-disease.csv` – medical features like Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, etc.
